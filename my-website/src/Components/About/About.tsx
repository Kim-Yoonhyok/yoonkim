                <p>
                    I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating and building things.
                    I'm currently studying management engineering at the University of Waterloo
                    and have worked on a variety of projects ranging from web development to machine learning.
                    I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Some of my hobbies include working out, playing soccer, and listening to music. As much as
                    I love coding, I also enjoy taking a break and spending time with friends and family. I belive
                    that it's important to have a good work-life balance and to take care of both your mental and
                    physical health. I am always looking to have a good time and enjoy life to the fullest.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I'm always looking to connect with new people and learn from their experiences. If you have any
                    questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always open to new opportunities.
                </p>
